In instructor training, we talk about using minute cards as a way to get feedback from learners during the workshop as a form of 
[formative assessment for the instructors](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/15-practices/). Minute cards are really 
valuable for getting feedback and addressing questions and misconceptions during the workshop, but they’re also useful information to use
after the workshop to inform teaching strategies and improvements that could be made to the lesson. Even more importantly, you get notes 
that say what you’re doing well and things people are excited about, which is very inspiring as an instructor. So, what’s with minute 
cards?  

# What are minute cards?

Minute cards are an idea that Cate Pickens introduced to Software Carpentry. The idea is that you have an index card, or your handy 
[green and red sticky notes](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/formative-assessment/), and before each break, you ask learners to write 
on one side, or on the green note, “one thing you learned or liked” and on the other side or the red sticky note write “one thing you’re
confused about.” These minute cards are the ‘ticket’ people can turn in before they go get lunch or leave the workshop. These are all 
hand written on the notecards and are anonymous. (As a side note, we do this with a Google form for online instructor training events).
The ‘minute cards’ take just about a minute for the learners to fill out - hence the name!   

# How to use minute cards during the workshops

So, you get all this valuable feedback. Now what? With your co-instructor look through the notes. Pull out the awesome or funny ones and
smile. Other note might have suggestions. If for instance you see a few notes asking you to slow down, then you have a better 
understanding of the pace of the room, and it would be a good idea to slow down. You might even want, when people get back from break, to
go back and review what ended up being confusing for the learners. Some notes may have specific questions. If you see the same question
more than once, it would be good to address that question when people come back from break. Framing it as ‘many people had this question’
also makes people feel like they’re not alone with a question, which is important for building confidence. Sometimes there might be a 
question that just one person has, but it’s a fundamental concept enough that you would want to address it. If there are questions that 
only one person has that are a little outside the scope, you can answer those question in the Etherpad. Overall, the notes are a great 
way to hear about the things people are excited about learning and feel some of their enthusiasm, and to make sure you’re on track with 
your teaching during the workshop.  

# After the workshop

Once the workshop is over, we have to switch our attention back to answering all those emails we missed over the last two days. However,
the notes are still really valuable pieces of information. Here are some ideas of what to do with your minute cards:   
 
- Use the information to inform your personal teaching strategies or style.  
- Add an issue to the lesson that the note references. If for instance a few people mention things that they wish they had learned, or 
things that seemed out of order, file an issue on that lesson to let people know this suggestion. This is super helpful for the
instructors who will be teaching this lesson after you!  
- Add an issue to a lesson about what people liked about the lesson. Knowing what’s working well is just as important as knowing what’s not working!  
- Share them on Twitter! Take a picture of a sticky note and put it on Twitter and add @datacarpentry to the post. Of course the positive 
ones are great, but if it’s something you also see as being important constructive feedback, those are great too!   
- Put the happy sticky notes up on the wall in your office. Remember the positive impact you’re having on people, especially that day that you get comments back from Reviewer number 3.  

Minute cards are more than just pretty pieces of paper. They’re useful pieces of feedback for you as an instructor and for the community 
as a whole.
